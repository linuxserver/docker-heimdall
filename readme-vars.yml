  ### Adding password protection
  
  This image now supports password protection through htpasswd. Run the following command on your host to generate the htpasswd file `docker exec -it heimdall htpasswd -c /config/nginx/.htpasswd <username>`. Replace <username> with a username of your choice and you will be asked to enter a password. New installs will automatically pick it up and implement password protected access. Existing users updating their image can delete their site config at `/config/nginx/site-confs/default` and restart the container after updating the image. A new site config with htpasswd support will be created in its place.
